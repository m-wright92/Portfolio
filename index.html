    <h3>My Journey With Epicodus:</h3>
    <p>This first week has been full of a ton of learning here at Epicodus. I've enjoyed the opportunity to learn something new while simoultaneously getting to know some of my wonderful classmates. While daunting at first, it all feels like it's coming together now that we're building our first independant projects! I can't wait to see what everyone comes up with!</p>
    <p>We have covered what seems like a ton of topics already this first week, but we've made some great headway. I hope that will be aparent when comparing some of my prior work(linked in the sidebar) with the page that i've created today. I've chosen to only highlight a few of the many projects we've worked on so far and I'll talk briefly about those I've chosen.</p>

    <h4>My First Webpage</h4>
    <p>This one is fairly self explanatory. It was one of the first playground pages to test out some basic principles. I used <span class="languages">HTML</span> and very basic <span class="languages">CSS</span> to adjust the fonts. It links to the Epicodus website as well as to a page of "My favorite things" that aren't actually my favorite or even about me. I also haven't even linked the Favorite Things page back to the home page that leads to it.</p>

    <h4>Shrek Blog</h4>
    <p>While the requirement was nothing about Shrek, Jess and I figured we'd spice up the blog page by making it about the main man himself. This site also is pretty basic, arguably even more basic than My First Webpage. It has zero interactivity, we couldnt get the png background to be transparant, and 99% of the text is just lorem ipsum. But we used basic <span class="languages">CSS</span> to modify the text and background of this <em><strong>VERY</strong></em> beautiful <span class="languages">HTML</span> page. It was also my first project that I added a README file to using <span class="languages">MD</span> (shorthand for markdown.)</p>

    <h4>Pet Shelter</h4>
    <p>I'd say that this one was one of the more fun pages to work on so far because it was during the time we learned a way how to get our columns to properly align because initially they were aligned in what I could best describe as a step down style. We also worked out how to get our images to properly fit within the columns we had set and scale as the page was resized. This page was all <span class="languages">HTML</span>and then suprisingly little <span class="languages">CSS</span>.</p>

    <h4>Bootstrap Testing</h4>
    <p>This project was a little more hands-off as it was mostly just following along with a lesson to see and verify how you can handle making columns and rows within the bootstrap framework. Though working with this did help to breakdown some of the useful things you can do with bootstrap including the jumbotron, cards, and grid system. I used some of these elements to help build the page you're viewing right now! Bootstrap sure does help to make powerful changes to your <span class="languages">HTML</span> that you can further interact with using your own custom <span class="languages">CSS</span> stylesheet.</p>

    <h4>My Pets</h4>
    <p>My pet info page was one of the earlier pages I started, however it's one that I am planning to continuously update using new tools that we learn in about in class to see how nice I can eventually get it to look and function. In its current form it still has a bit of work to get to a nice place, but I have put some out of class time in adding new things to both the <span class="languages">HTML</span> and <span class="languages">CSS</span> and just the other day I added bootstrap as well!</p>
