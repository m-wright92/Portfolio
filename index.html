    <h3>My Journey With Epicodus:</h3>
    <p>This first week has been full of a ton of learning here at Epicodus. I've enjoyed the opportunity to learn something new while simoultaneously getting to know some of my wonderful classmates. While daunting at first, it all feels like it's coming together now that we're building our first independant projects! I can't wait to see what everyone comes up with!</p>
    <p>We have covered what seems like a ton of topics already this first week, but we've made some great headway. I hope that will be aparent when comparing some of my prior work(linked in the sidebar) with the page that i've created today. I've chosen to only highlight a few of the many projects we've worked on so far and I'll talk briefly about those I've chosen.</p>

    <h4>My First Webpage</h4>
    <p>This one is fairly self explanatory. It was one of the first playground pages to test out some basic principles. I used <span class="languages">HTML</span> and very basic <span class="languages">CSS</span> to adjust the fonts. It links to the Epicodus website as well as to a page of "My favorite things" that aren't actually my favorite or even about me. I also haven't even linked the Favorite Things page back to the home page that leads to it.</p>
