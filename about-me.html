    <h3>Background</h2>
    <h4>School</h4>
    <p>This part is pretty short, as Epicodus is the first time I have taken any classes since I graduated highschool back in 2011. Not for lack of interest in schooling, I just had no idea what I wanted to do with myself for a career, especially one that would cost me tens of thousands of dollars or more to pursue.</p>

    <h4>Job Experience</h4>
    <p>I have done a number of different jobs since I started working. I have a general interest in learning new skills and trades, however there are many that don't give many opportunities in the way of providing a comfortable life outside of work. Some of the jobs I've done include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tech support via phone/online chat</li>
      <li>Assembly at a manufacturing company that designed and made lab science equipment</li>
      <li>Dough roller for a pizza restaurant</li>
      <li>Line cook at a number of restaurants</li>
      <li>Kitchen Manager at a pizza restaurant</li>
      <li>Batch making upwards of 50,000lbs of paint daily</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Why Epicodus?</h4>
    <p>As you can see I've tried quite a few different things, and those aren't even all the jobs i've done. So after seeing a friend from highschool talking online about the success she had after Epicodus, I talked with her about the experience. She gave me a lot of wonderful info and spoke very highly of her experience, she even wrote the "Code School Survival Tract" that we had to read in the pre-work for the course. After talking with her I did my research on the school as well as other similar options and finally decided that Epicodus was the right route for me, and I'm so glad I did!</p>

    <h4>My Interests</h4>
    <p>Outside of school and work I like to think I have a lot of fun. I've always had a passion for food(both making it and eating it.) One of my favorite things to do is to try out new restaurants, which is great now that I just recently moved to portland. The options are <em><strong>ENDLESS</strong></em>. I am also a big fan of video games, though I've found myself not having as much time to commit to them as I once did. Despite that, I still love every second that I get to spend with a controller in my hand or keyboard under my fingers.</p>
    <p>When I'm not eating or gaming I also enjoy traveling to new places and hiking or camping. Nothing is quite as refreshing as getting away from the house, and the more time you spend away the more you realize how much you enjoy your home as well. Hopefully with a career in coding I'll be able to get out and travel to places I've never been and really enjoy the world around me.</p>
