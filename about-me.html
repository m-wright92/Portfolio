    <h3>Background</h2>
    <h4>School</h4>
    <p>This part is pretty short, as Epicodus is the first time I have taken any classes since I graduated highschool back in 2011. Not for lack of interest in schooling, I just had no idea what I wanted to do with myself for a career, especially one that would cost me tens of thousands of dollars or more to pursue.</p>

    <h4>Job Experience</h4>
    <p>I have done a number of different jobs since I started working. I have a general interest in learning new skills and trades, however there are many that don't give many opportunities in the way of providing a comfortable life outside of work. Some of the jobs I've done include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tech support via phone/online chat</li>
      <li>Assembly at a manufacturing company that designed and made lab science equipment</li>
      <li>Dough roller for a pizza restaurant</li>
      <li>Line cook at a number of restaurants</li>
      <li>Kitchen Manager at a pizza restaurant</li>
      <li>Batch making upwards of 50,000lbs of paint daily</li>
    </ul>
